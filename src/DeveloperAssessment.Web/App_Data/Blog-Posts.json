Get into the habit of asking open-ended questions that answer the Who, What, Where, When, Why and How. Using this approach will allow you to delve deep and gain an understanding of what your website should\u0026nbsp;include\u0026nbsp;to\u0026nbsp;build a considered site map.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConsider your Information Architecture\u0026nbsp;(IA)\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHow your\u0026nbsp;content is organised and divided across the website is a crucial aspect of UX design.\u0026nbsp;Without effective sorting, most users would be completely lost when navigating\u0026nbsp;a\u0026nbsp;site\u0026nbsp;and there\u2019s no point having\u0026nbsp;memorable features if they can\u2019t be found!\u0026nbsp;Use card sorting exercises, tree tests, user journey mapping\u0026nbsp;and user flow diagrams to\u0026nbsp;form\u0026nbsp;an understanding of how\u0026nbsp;best\u0026nbsp;to display your content in a logical and accessible way.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConduct\u0026nbsp;qualitative and\u0026nbsp;quantitative\u0026nbsp;research\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Google Analytics is extremely useful, it doesn\u2019t hold all the answers.\u0026nbsp;Google\u0026nbsp;Analytics is great at telling you\u0026nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;your users are doing, but it doesn\u2019t give you\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;insight into\u0026nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E\u0026nbsp;they\u2019re doing it.

In development, it\u2019s mostly looking at what we\u2019ve done before, what we\u0026nbsp;can\u0026nbsp;use to help the client and sometimes looking at using a new piece of technology\u0026nbsp;to\u0026nbsp;help businesses evolve.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0026nbsp;Do\u0026nbsp;You\u0026nbsp;Enjoy\u0026nbsp;Most\u0026nbsp;About\u0026nbsp;Your\u0026nbsp;Job?\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s the people.\u0026nbsp;It\u2019s a bit like a family atmosphere here.\u0026nbsp;We\u0026nbsp;take banter from each other\u2026\u0026nbsp;and give it back just as\u0026nbsp;much,\u0026nbsp;but we\u2019re all friendly and we listen\u0026nbsp;and value\u0026nbsp;everyone\u2019s\u0026nbsp;opinions.\u0026nbsp;It allows us to\u0026nbsp;feel\u0026nbsp;comfortable and more vocal, everyone is willing to collaborate and converse about a project.\u0026nbsp;It\u2019s important we\u0026nbsp;encourage\u0026nbsp;each team\u0026nbsp;to have their say from their own expertise\u0026nbsp;and experience.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0026nbsp;Have\u0026nbsp;You\u0026nbsp;Found\u0026nbsp;Challenging?\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably one of the most challenging parts of my role is when we inherit code from\u0026nbsp;another agency.\u0026nbsp;As we offer audits, we often\u0026nbsp;takeover code from other companies. It\u2019s a testament to our team that we can fix\u0026nbsp;these\u0026nbsp;issues that\u0026nbsp;affect\u0026nbsp;businesses.\u0026nbsp;During this process, we sit\u0026nbsp;with the client and use\u0026nbsp;our problem-solving skills to fix their problems, advise\u0026nbsp;them what to focus on, what they can improve\u0026nbsp;and how they can do this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Serverlec Technologies was an Umbraco site we inherited, and the code base was a bit of a mess. We patched up as much as we could but, in the process, we built a great relationship with the client and ended up taking the site on for a full rebuild. It gave them the confidence that we could transform their site into what they needed and wanted.\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0026nbsp;Is Your Favourite Project You\u2019ve Worked\u0026nbsp;On\u0026nbsp;And Why?\u0026nbsp;\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably Stericycle.\u0026nbsp;This project was completed on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.netconstruct.com/kentico-developer-kentico-12-kentico-web-developer-gold-partner-netconstruct\u0022\u003EKentico 12 MVC\u003C/a\u003E which is a new platform and it was also multicultural which is the first time we had to do this for\u0026nbsp;MVC.

      "htmlContent": "\u003Cp\u003EAs a leading Kentico web development agency, we take enhancing our knowledge and staying on top when it comes to Kentico seriously. Regularly attending and often participating in their events around the globe, members of the NetConstruct team including MD, Jonathan and Developer, Liam, attended Kentico Connection on 18-19 September in Brno, Czech Republic. The insightful event was just the right mix of software news, Kentico culture and announcements for the future. Here are our top takeaways from the event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ECommitment to Dual Product Strategy\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the rebranding of Kentico Cloud to Kentico Kontent taking place, there was a lot of discussion around their dual product strategy, defining this clearly to partners and end users. Confusion has been rife over Kentico\u2019s CaaS (Content as a Service) product but Kentico Connection clarified their long-term commitment to the original EMS product. Clear positioning of both products means Kentico now has a distinct solution for the needs of any business who is serious about digital marketing. \u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EOpenness to Feedback\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA hallmark of Kentico\u2019s culture is their willingness to take on board feedback from customers, partners, developers and integrators. This was obvious during the event through the numerous conversations with both company executives and other key staff members who invited and discussed our opinion on a range of product and strategy related matters.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EIncreased Focus on Larger Projects\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWith continued endorsement from both\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.gartner.com/en\u0022\u003EGartner\u003C/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\u0022https://go.forrester.com/\u0022\u003EForrester\u003C/a\u003E, Kentico EMS is now regarded by many as a true enterprise product. While Kentico initially positioned the EMS as a mid-market solution, there is no denying its use in a growing range of very large digital solutions. Kentico Cloud, is also being used across large-scale solutions, for example, a project for AC Milan Football Club to deliver a heavy throughput of content.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EKentico 2020\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe release of their updated software is planned for September 2020 and the project has been given the official code name of Phoenix. Phoenix symbolises the rise from the ashes after burning away the remainder of Kentico webforms. The current Kentico MVC take up is approximately 40% of users with the software looking to push that figure closer towards 100% through the release of Kentico 2020 next year. The key improvements expected are:\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n  \u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilt in Automatic Dynamic Routing:\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;Bespoke routing implementation will no longer be required. Kentico\u2019s routing will instead work alongside custom routing, standalone, or completely disabled.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n  \u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELinked pages:\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026nbsp;This feature will allow for reusable content within the content tree.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n  \u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESupport for .NET Core\u003C/strong\u003E: Kentico libraries will be fully migrated to .NET Standard 2.0 once the release has launched. This will enable Kentico MVC projects to be built with the latest .NET Core release version 3.0.\u003C/li\u003E\r\n\u003C/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EKentico Kontent\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther updates on Kentico Kontent were shared during the event with the new release of the Content Management API (CM API v2) coming soon. This version will bring more advanced support for publishing, unpublishing, workflows, content types, snippets, taxonomy and languages. CM API will no longer be for importing alone, it will also allow for integration and automation too.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWebhook debugging tools have also been added to Kentico Kontent, allowing developers to debug webhook responses with ease. In addition, advanced configuration options have been implemented which will enable specific content types and workflow steps to trigger specific webhooks.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EKentico MVC Marketplace\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring Kentico Connection, their MVC Marketplace was promoted regularly, encouraging partners and developers to submit work to help enhance the Kentico community. Something we\u2019re keen to be part of, NetConstruct developer Liam submitted an MVC form component prior to Kentico Connection which can be viewed\u0026nbsp;\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/liamgold/font-awesome-form-component\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA growing list of custom elements have been added to GitHub, a marketplace for developers to share new functionality and integrations. A number of example eCommerce integrations for Kentico Kontent are now readily available on GitHub which can be added to existing and new Kentico Kontent builds.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EJonathan and Liam were unanimous in their opinions that Kentico Connection brilliant and informative across all bases. A big thank you to Kentico for hosting us and delivering yet another intriguing Kentico Connection, sharing further insight into their future plans and advancements. We\u2019re already looking forward to the next one! #KenticoConnection2019\u003C/p\u003E",
